# You can specify default log routing here if you want:
# log_name = drive-audit
# log_facility = LOG_LOCAL0
# log_level = INFO
# log_address = /dev/log
# The following caps the length of log lines to the value given; no limit if
# set to 0, the default.
# log_max_line_length = 0
#
# minutes = 60
# error_limit = 1
# recon_cache_path = /var/cache/swift
# unmount_failed_device = True
#
# By default, drive-audit logs only to syslog. Setting this option True
# makes drive-audit log to console in addition to syslog.
# log_to_console = False
#
# Location of the log file with globbing
# pattern to check against device errors.
# log_file_pattern = /var/log/kern.*[!.][!g][!z]
#
# Regular expression patterns to be used to locate
# device blocks with errors in the log file. Currently
# the default ones are as follows:
#   \berror\b.*\b(sd[a-z]{1,2}\d?)\b
#   \b(sd[a-z]{1,2}\d?)\b.*\berror\b
# One can overwrite the default ones by providing
# new expressions using the format below:
# Format: regex_pattern_X = regex_expression
# Example:
#   regex_pattern_1 = \berror\b.*\b(dm-[0-9]{1,2}\d?)\b
