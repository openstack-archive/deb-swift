    Restore old SIGPIPE handler in a proxy server test.
    
    I think not doing this was setting the SIGPIPE handler to signal.SIG_DFL
    instead of the Python default of signal.SIG_IGN.  This could cause other
    tests which make a client stop reading before all data "chunks" are read
    to fail harder than they should (i.e. the SIGPIPE there is benign and
    even expected--the other side of the socket really did get closed
    early).
    
    Fixed leak on 499s
    
    This fixes an issue where Request objects (and related objects) were
    not getting garbage collected when a 499 (client disconnect) occurred
    for responses that still would have had more than the proxy server's
    client chunk size left to send.
    
    Fixed bug #1055834

    Upating proxy-server StatsD logging.
    
    Removed many StatsD logging calls in proxy-server and added
    swift-informant-style catch-all logging in the proxy-logger middleware.
    Many errors previously rolled into the "proxy-server.<type>.errors"
    counter will now appear broken down by response code and with timing
    data at: "proxy-server.<type>.<verb>.<status>.timing".  Also, bytes
    transferred (sum of in + out) will be at:
    "proxy-server.<type>.<verb>.<status>.xfer".  The proxy-logging
    middleware can get its StatsD config from standard vars in [DEFAULT] or
    from access_log_statsd_* config vars in its config section.
    
    Similarly to Swift Informant, request methods ("verbs") are filtered
    using the new proxy-logging config var, "log_statsd_valid_http_methods"
    which defaults to GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, and COPY.  Requests with
    methods not in this list use "BAD_METHOD" for <verb> in the metric name.
    To avoid user error, access_log_statsd_valid_http_methods is also
    accepted.
    
    Previously, proxy-server metrics used "Account", "Container", and
    "Object" for the <type>, but these are now all lowercase.
    
    Updated the admin guide's StatsD docs to reflect the above changes and
    also include the "proxy-server.<type>.handoff_count" and
    "proxy-server.<type>.handoff_all_count" metrics.
    
    The proxy server now saves off the original req.method and proxy_logging
    will use this if it can (both for request logging and as the "<verb>" in
    the statsd timing metric).  This fixes bug 1025433.
    
    Removed some stale access_log_* related code in proxy/server.py.  Also
    removed the BaseApplication/Application distinction as it's no longer
    necessary.
    
    Fixed up the sample config files a bit (logging lines, mostly).
    
    Fixed typo in SAIO development guide.
    
    Got proxy_logging.py test coverage to 100%.
    
    Fixed proxy_logging.py for PEP8 v1.3.2.
    
    Enhanced test.unit.FakeLogger to track more calls to enable testing
    StatsD metric calls.

    Remove the gettext wrapper of server_type.
    
    The gettext wrapper of server_type in controllers is used to translate
    server_type in log. But the transfer_headers function which used to
    filter the illegal metadata headers use the wrapped server_type. So, it
    will cause problems that 'X-Account-Meta-' and 'X-Container-Meta-' would
    be filtered when the language of operating system is not english, such
    as Chinese or Japnese. So, I removed the wrapper.

    Misc. swift-bench improvements.
    
    swift-bench now honors the environment variables, ST_AUTH, ST_USER, and
    ST_KEY like python-swiftclient does.
    
    Added --lower-object-size (or -l) command-line option which, if
    specified, will turn a specified --object-size into --upper-object-size.
    It will raise a ValueError if --object-size is not specified or is <=
    --lower-object-size.
    
    BenchController how handles SIGINT (KeyboardInterrupt) similarly to the
    swift command-line client: the first Ctrl-C will make it fast-track to
    completion (no new PUT or GET operations are started, but everything PUT
    is DELETE'ed).  A second Ctrl-C will immediately exit.  The behavior for
    SIGTERM is unchanged (a single SIGTERM will immediately terminate the
    process).
    
    Added a sample configuration file for swift-bench, with documenting
    comments.

    Fix when rate_limit_after_segment kicks in.
    
    If rate_limit_after_segment was 10 in the proxy config, then after 10
    segments were coughed up by _load_next_segment() with no calls to
    sleep(), the 11th segment would not trigger a sleep() call.  The 12th
    segment triggered a sleep(0) call, but it was only after the 13th
    segment was loaded that an actual rate-limiting (non-zero) sleep got
    called.
    
    With this patch, a rate_limit_after_segment of 10 will start sleeping
    the correct amount after the 11th segment.
    
    Updated proxy-server.conf-sample with rate_limit_after_segment and
    rate_limit_segments_per_sec.

    Add device name to *-replicator.removes for DBs
    
    To tell when replication for a device has finished, it's important to
    know when the replicator is removing objects.  This was previously
    handled for the object-replicator
    (object-replicator.partition.delete.count.<device> and
    object-replicator.partition.update.count.<device> metrics) but not the
    account and container replicators.
    
    This patch extends the existing DB removal count metrics to make them
    per-device.  The new metrics are:
     account-replicator.removes.<device>
     container-replicator.removes.<device>
    
    There's also a bonus refactoring and increased test coverage of the DB
    replicator code.

    A couple minor tweaks to the SAIO guide.
    
    Added "-p" to mkdir cmds in a "set -e" script (/etc/rc.local).
    
    /var/log/swift gets owned by the group "adm", but isn't group writeable
    by default, so the find/rm in "resetswift" fails.  So I added a chmod to
    add group-write for that directory tree.
    
    Added commands for installing tox.

    Retuen a reasonable response to client.
    
    As we use the 'account_autocreate' for auto-create accounts, we send a
    request to HEAD an account which is just deleted(the account-reaper not
    reclaim it immediately), the proxy-server will return 'HTTP 500 Internal
    Server Error'.
    In my opinion, this is unreasonable, so I change the code in swift/proxy
    /server.py for returning a reasonable response. I modified the code in
    POST, GETorHEAD and account_info. At last, I modified some code in the
    unittest test/unit/proxy/test_server.py.

    Fixed a couple config gets which weren't using TRUE_VALUES (hopefully
    the last ones?).
    
    Removed a deprecated parameter from
    swift.common.db.ContainerBroker.list_objects_iter() a "TODO" which dates
    back to the original import of Swift into github.
    
    Also made AccountBroker.reclaim()'s docstring match its arg names.

    handle exception correctly in _make_app_iter_reader
    
    _make_app_iter_reader uses a queue to pass read data to
    _make_app_iter, and uses an empty string as a terminator.  The problem
    is that it pushes the same terminator even if it fails to reads the
    data.  If an exception happens before pushing all data to the queue,
    _make_app_iter exits without yielding all data.  In that case,
    proxy-server stops in the middle of sending data, and a client waits
    for all data to come infinitely.
    
    This patch uses a boolean value for the terminator instead of an empty
    string to distinguish the results, and raises an exception in the
    error cases.  Fixes bug 890888.

    all in one setup rc.local needs -p for mkdir command
    
    bug fixes for swift 1033089
    Swift 1.6.0 All in One setup uses rc.local to create a set of
    directories like the following:
       /var/cache/swift /var/cache/swift2 /var/cache/swift3
       /var/cache/swift4
       /var/run/swift
    without -p for mkdir command, when some of these directories
    already exist, the rc.local fails so that the next set of
    command won't execute. This causes swift fail to start because
    of /var/run/swift does not exist. Adding -p to both mkdir
    command solves this problem.

    Use custom encoding for RingData, not pickle.
    
    Serialize RingData in a versioned, custom format which is a combination
    of a JSON-encoded header and .tostring() dumps of the
    replica2part2dev_id arrays.  This format deserializes hundreds of times
    faster than rings serialized with Python 2.7's pickle (a significant
    performance regression for ring loading between Python 2.6 and Python
    2.7).  Fixes bug 1031954.
    
    swift.common.ring.ring.RingData is now responsible for serialization and
    deserialization of its data via a new load() class method and save()
    object method.  The new implementation is backward-compatible; if a ring
    does not begin with a new-style magic string, it is assumed to be an
    old-style pickle-dumped ring and is handled as before.  So new Swift
    code can read old rings, but old Swift code will not be able to read
    newly-serialized rings. THIS SHOULD BE MENTIONED PROMINENTLY IN THE
    RELEASE NOTES.
    
    I didn't want to bite of more than necessary, so I didn't mess with
    builder file serialization.

    Do not use pickle for serialization in memcache, but JSON
    
    We don't want to use pickle as it can execute arbitrary code. JSON is
    safer. However, note that it supports serialization for only some
    specific subset of object types; this should be enough for what we need,
    though.
    
    To avoid issues on upgrades (unability to read pickled values, and cache
    poisoning for old servers not understanding JSON), we add a
    memcache_serialization_support configuration option, with the following
    values:
    
     0 = older, insecure pickle serialization
     1 = json serialization but pickles can still be read (still insecure)
     2 = json serialization only (secure and the default)
    
    To avoid an instant full cache flush, existing installations should
    upgrade with 0, then set to 1 and reload, then after some time (24
    hours) set to 2 and reload. Support for 0 and 1 will be removed in
    future versions.
    
    Part of bug 1006414.

    Fixes regression with format=somethingelse
    
    The WebOb 1.2 support patch introduced a regression where an unknown
    format= query used to just default back to plain but now returns a
    400. This will break anyone that uses format=text for instance, or
    anything else "invalid".
    
    Arguably, it makes the most sense to 400 in the case of an invalid
    format requested, but since it is also a backwards compatibility
    break, I recommend we keep the previous behavior. Retaining the
    previous behavior seems less damaging than enforcing the new
    behavior.

    Logging improvements: handoffs and thread locals
    
    A warning log line is emitted whenever the proxy has to use a handoff
    node. Monitoring these warnings can indicate a problem within your
    cluster; however, you can disable these log lines by setting the
    proxy conf's log_handoffs to false.
    
    While working on this, I also noticed why many proxy log lines did
    not have txn_id and client_ip -- subcoroutines. Now the logger thread
    locals are copied to the subcoroutines.

    Forbid substrings based on a regexp in name_filter middleware
    
    In comments from https://review.openstack.org/8798 it was raised that it
    might make sense to forbid some substrings in the name_filter
    middleware.
    
    There is now a new forbidden_regexp option for the name_filter
    middleware to specify which substrings to forbid. The default is
    "/\./|/\.\./|/\.$|/\.\.$" (or in a non-regexp language: the /./ and /../
    substrings as well as strings ending with /. or /..).
    
    This can be useful for extra paranoia to avoid directory traversals
    (bug 1005908), or for more general filtering.

    Updated probe tests
    
    The probe tests were woefully out of date with all the changes that
    have ocurred since they were written. I've updated most of them and
    removed some that are hopeless outdated.
    
    I also greatly improved the timing issues (hopefully completely
    solved them? I ran them 25 times with no problems) and made them pep8
    1.3.1 safe.

    Validate devices and partitions to avoid directory traversals
    
    swift.common.utils.validate_device_partition is a new function to check
    that a device and a partition are valid. This means that they don't
    contain '/' and are not '.' or '..'.
    
    We use this new function every time we get devices and partitions from a
    request.

    The X-Object-Manifest header value should be url encoded to allow for
    "special" characters to be used. This fix decodes such encoding. A
    corresponding fix to python-swiftclient (and any other clients) needs

    add UDP protocol support for logger
    
    When a syslog daemon fails and SysLogHandler cannot reconnect to
    it, server processes (proxy, container, object, and more)
    would start consuming 100 % CPU and stop responding to requests.
    It is because the server process go into an infinite loop if they
    fail to reconnect to /dev/log.
    This problem happens only when using unix_sockets.
    
    This change enables us to use syslog without unix_sockets and fixes bug 780025.

    Commit 95786e5 made swift-get-nodes only output N handoff nodes, where
    N is the ring's replica count. This change leaves that behavior in
    place as the default, but adds the option -a/--all to print all the
    handoff nodes.
    
    This is handy if you're consuming the output with a script, e.g. if
    you're doing some analysis of the distribution of primary+handoff
    nodes for a particular set of things.

    check disk failure before syncing for each partition
    
    If disk failure happens while object replication is ongoing,
    object-replicator could replicate objects from other nodes to the root
    file system.  It is because object-replicator does no mount check
    (error check) at all after collect_jobs() is called, and it executes
    rsync based on the old partition information in update().
    
    This change prevents many objects from being written to the root file
    system wrongly and fixes bug 1014545.

    Make proxy-logging more like eventlet.posthook
    
    The old use of Eventlet's posthook process meant that responses that
    forgot to include content-length or transfer-encoding headers would
    get one tacked on, if Eventlet could guess what was probably meant. I
    added a bit of that logic into proxy-logging now as we saw some
    errors resulting from this.

    Make object server's caching more configurable.
    
    The object server had a constant KEEP_CACHE_SIZE = 5*1024*1024;
    unauthenticated GET requests for files smaller than KEEP_CACHE_SIZE
    would not evict the file from the kernel's buffer cache after it was
    read from disk.
    
    Now that hardcoded constant is a configuration parameter
    ("keep_cache_size"), and now there is also another parameter called
    "keep_cache_private". If set, then both authenticated and
    unauthenticated GET requests for small files will not evict the data
    from the buffer cache. The default values are 5 MiB and False,
    respectively, so the default behavior is the same.
    
    Bonus: the "mb_per_sync" parameter is now documented in the deployment
    guide.

    Fixed bug with container reclaim/report race
    
    Before, a really lagged cluster might not get its final report for a
    deleted container database sent to its corresponding account
    database. In such a case, the container database file would be
    permanently deleted while still leaving the container listed in the
    account database, never to be updated since the actual container
    database file was gone. The only way to fix such the situation before
    was to recreate and redelete the container.
    
    Now, the container database file will not be permanently deleted
    until it has sent its final report successfully to its corresponding
    account database.

    Fix starvation in object server with fast clients.
    
    When an object server was handling concurrent GET or POST requests
    from very fast clients, it would starve other connected clients. The
    greenthreads responsible for servicing the fast clients would hog the
    processor and only rarely yield to another greenthread.
    
    The reason this happens for GET requests is found in
    eventlet.greenio.GreenSocket, in the send() method. When you call
    .send(data) on a GreenSocket, it immediately calls .send(data) on its
    underlying real socket (socket._socketobject). If the real socket
    accepts all the data, then GreenSocket.send() returns without yielding
    to another greenthread. Only if the real socket failed to accept all
    the data (either .send(data) < len(data) or by raising EWOULDBLOCK)
    does the GreenSocket yield control.
    
    Under most workloads, this isn't a problem. The TCP connection to
    client X can only consume data so quickly, and therefore the
    greenthread serving client X will frequently encounter a full socket
    buffer and yield control, so no clients starve. However, when there's
    a lot of contention for a single object from a large number of fast
    clients (e.g. on a LAN connected w/10Gb Ethernet), then one winds up
    in a situation where reading from the disk is slower than writing to
    the network, and so full socket buffers become rare, and therefore so
    do context switches. The end result is that many clients time out
    waiting for data.
    
    The situation for PUT requests is analogous; GreenSocket.recv() seldom
    encounters EWOULDBLOCK, so greenthreads seldom yield.
    
    This patch calls eventlet.sleep() to yield control after each chunk,
    preventing any one greenthread's IO from blocking the hub for very
    long.
    
    This code has the flaw that it will greenthread-switch twice when a
    send() or recv() does block, but since there isn't a way to find out
    if a switch occurred or not, there's no way to avoid it. Since
    greenlet switches are quite fast (faster than system calls, which the
    object server does a lot of), this shouldn't have a significant
    performance impact.

    with no content-length on 204 No Content responses where it
    used to return content-length: 0 and no transfer-encoding
    header at all.

    Expand recon middleware support
    
    Expand recon middleware to include support for account and container
    servers in addition to the existing object servers. Also add support
    for retrieving recent information from auditors, replicators, and
    updaters. In the case of certain checks (such as container auditors)
    the stats returned are only for the most recent path processed.
    
    The middleware has also been refactored and should now also handle
    errors better in cases where stats are unavailable.
    
    While new check's have been added the output from pre-existing
    check's has not changed. This should allow existing 3rd party
    utilities such as the Swift ZenPack to continue to function.

    !! Changed db_preallocation to False
    
    Long explanation, but hopefully answers any questions.
    
    We don't like changing the default behavior of Swift unless there's a
    really good reason and, up until now, I've tried doing this with this
    new db_preallocation setting.
    
    For clusters with dedicated account/container servers that usually
    have fewer disks overall but SSD for speed, having db_preallocation
    on will gobble up disk space quite quickly and the fragmentation it's
    designed to fight isn't that big a speed impact to SSDs anyway.
    
    For clusters with account/container servers spread across all servers
    along with object servers usually having standard disks for cost,
    having db_preallocation off will cause very fragmented database files
    impacting speed, sometimes dramatically.
    
    Weighing these two negatives, it seems the second is the lesser evil.
    The first can cause disks to fill up and disable the cluster. The
    second will cause performance degradation, but the cluster will still
    function.
    
    Furthermore, if just one piece of code that touches all databases
    runs with db_preallocation on, it's effectively on for the whole
    cluster. We discovered this most recently when we finally configured
    everything within the Swift codebase to have db_preallocation off,
    only to find out Slogging didn't know about the new setting and so
    ran with it on and starting filling up SSDs.
    
    So that's why I'm proposing this change to the default behavior.
    
    We will definitely need to post a prominent notice of this change
    with the next release.

    Adding StatsD logging to Swift.
    
    Documentation, including a list of metrics reported and their semantics,
    is in the Admin Guide in a new section, "Reporting Metrics to StatsD".
    An optional "metric prefix" may be configured which will be prepended to
    every metric name sent to StatsD.
    
    Here is the rationale for doing a deep integration like this versus only
    sending metrics to StatsD in middleware.  It's the only way to report
    some internal activities of Swift in a real-time manner. So to have one
    way of reporting to StatsD and one place/style of configuration, even
    some things (like, say, timing of PUT requests into the proxy-server)
    which could be logged via middleware are consistently logged the same
    way (deep integration via the logger delegate methods).
    
    When log_statsd_host is configured, get_logger() injects a
    swift.common.utils.StatsdClient object into the logger as
    logger.statsd_client.  Then a set of delegate methods on LogAdapter
    either pass through to the StatsdClient object or become no-ops. This
    allows StatsD logging to look like:
        self.logger.increment('some.metric.here')
    and do the right thing in all cases and with no messy conditional logic.
    
    I wanted to use the pystatsd module for the StatsD client, but the
    version on PyPi is lagging the git repo (and is missing both the prefix
    functionality and timing_since() method).  So I wrote my
    swift.common.utils.StatsdClient.  The interface is the same as
    pystatsd.Client, but the code was written from scratch.  It's pretty
    simple, and the tests I added cover it.  This also frees Swift from an
    optional dependency on the pystatsd module, making this feature easier
    to enable.
    
    There's test coverage for the new code and all existing tests continue
    to pass.
    
    Refactored out _one_audit_pass() method in swift/account/auditor.py and
    swift/container/auditor.py.
    
    Fixed some misc. PEP8 violations.
    
    Misc test cleanups and refactorings (particularly the way "fake logging"
    is handled).

    Speed up swift-get-nodes by 2x.
    
    It was loading the ring off disk once to print the primary nodes, and
    then loading the whole thing off disk again to print the handoff
    nodes. Changed it to only load the ring off disk once.

    As-unique-as-possible partition replica placement.
    
    This commit introduces a new algorithm for assigning partition
    replicas to devices. Basically, the ring builder organizes the devices
    into tiers (first zone, then IP/port, then device ID). When placing a
    replica, the ring builder looks for the emptiest device (biggest
    parts_wanted) in the furthest-away tier.
    
    In the case where zone-count >= replica-count, the new algorithm will
    give the same results as the one it replaces. Thus, no migration is
    needed.
    
    In the case where zone-count < replica-count, the new algorithm
    behaves differently from the old algorithm. The new algorithm will
    distribute things evenly at each tier so that the replication is as
    high-quality as possible, given the circumstances. The old algorithm
    would just crash, so again, no migration is needed.
    
    Handoffs have also been updated to use the new algorithm. When
    generating handoff nodes, first the ring looks for nodes in other
    zones, then other ips/ports, then any other drive. The first handoff
    nodes (the ones in other zones) will be the same as before; this
    commit just extends the list of handoff nodes.
    
    The proxy server and replicators have been altered to avoid looking at
    the ring's replica count directly. Previously, with a replica count of
    C, RingData.get_nodes() and RingData.get_part_nodes() would return
    lists of length C, so some other code used the replica count when it
    needed the number of nodes. If two of a partition's replicas are on
    the same device (e.g. with 3 replicas, 2 devices), then that
    assumption is no longer true. Fortunately, all the proxy server and
    replicators really needed was the number of nodes returned, which they
    already had. (Bonus: now the only code that mentions replica_count
    directly is in the ring and the ring builder.)

    Added associated_projects.rst
    
    In the interest of keeping the core Swift code repository less
    complex, but still offering a quick way to find associated projects
    that enhance or use Swift, I've added this new Associated Projects
    page prominently to the Swift documentation.
    
    This will allow much less barrier to entry on enhancing Swift as
    other projects can work independently and will only need to wait on
    the core Swift project for approval of minimal tweaks to the core
    Swift code base.
    
    It will also allow an easy central place to find cool associated
    projects that otherwise might go unnoticed or even duplicated.
    
    The plan is to move non-essential projects that are currently
    embedded in the Swift repository out into their own projects with
    links to them on this new page. This would include items such as
    (just what I can think of right now): bin/swift command line tool and
    clients, swift-bench, swift-dispersion, TempURL, FormPost, StaticWeb,
    Rate Limiting, Swift3, Domain Remap, and CNAME Lookup.
    
    After all that is done, those projects will be able to move forward
    much more quickly and new developers for Swift itself will have much
    less to learn and get confused about.

    Let some swift-ring-builder commands take >1 arg.
    
    `swift-ring-builder X.builder [add|set_weight|set_info|remove]` can
    now work on multiple devices at once.
    
    This allows for faster bulk operations; for example, if an
    administrator has to add 48 new devices to the ring, then this lets
    them do it in one command invocation. Since each invocation of
    swift-ring-builder follows a deserialize-operate-serialize pattern,
    using the bulk form of the commands on N devices will save N-1
    [de]serializations.

    Implement unit_test config to disable syslog.
    
    bug 701248
    bug 819303
    
    This change makes syslog optional, by providing a unit test
    config with the ability to cause test/unit/__init__.py to
    replace SysLogHandler with a fake logging class. The
    default behavior is unchanged.
    
    FakeLogger now inherits directly from Handler and mocks out
    its API - this was a backward-compatibility issue.

    Restore the syntax -U tenant:user
    
    On a relatively recent build of swift, all my scripts blew up with
    "No tenant specified". It was caused by the fix to add --os_tenant_name,
    commit ID:  208b8e85a80e46ddb49dc2035cb292570a20c7db
    
    This patch restores the old behavior. I tested it to work with old
    swauth-based Swift, new Keystone-based Swift, in the latter case using
    both -U and --os_tenant_name arguments.
    
    Note that this patch permits to use a literal colon in the user name
    with the new syntax, as long as tenant is specified. Empty tenant
    names are not allowed with either syntax.

    Fixed TestObjectController.test_PUT_auto_content_type()
    
    The test was failing silently. To catch these errors the response
    from controller.PUT() is now checked.
    
    Fixes to the TestObjectController.test_PUT_auto_content_type():
    * Check for the correct 'Content-Type' header in the fake connect() method
    * Pass in the correct number of responses to fake_http_connect()
    * Pass a 'transfer-encoding' header to PUT() so that
      constraints.check_object_creation() passes
    * Pass the correct number of elements in the 'expected' iter to the
      test_content_type() method

    Fix colorization of "hash" in SAIO doc.
    
    Admittedly, this is ridiculously trivial, but the coloring of
    "hash" always peeved me. Not so much that it existed, but that
    I did not understand what caused it. After consulting our Sphinx
    experts, it turned out that the code block was considered code
    in Python and "hash" is a reserved word in Python, so it was
    colored.
    
    One option is to declare the code block "ini", which is what
    it is, but that causes the block stand out just as badly, unless
    we highlight every one of them. So, for now use "none".

    Make swift client easier to wrap
    
    In the process of wrapping for profiling, a trivial wrap with def main()
    ended in a ton of these:
        NameError: global name 'parser' is not defined
    
    A closer investigation revealed an apparent confusion in argument names.
    The problem was introduced by commit 985968f76550251904b64d12de025fa5d65ed03f
    of November 2010. Note that Greg fixed st_delete() correctly in that one,
    but apparently forgot the others.
    
    Unit tests pass for both current (bad) code, and the patched code.
    By the magic of Python scoping, current code works, just impossible
    to wrap for a quick hack.

    object versioning
    
    Object versioning in swift is implemented by setting a flag on the container
    to tell swift to version all objects in the container. The flag is the
    ``X-Versions-Location`` header on the container, and its value is the
    container where the versions are stored.
    
    When data is ``PUT`` into a versioned container (a container with the
    versioning flag turned on), the existing data in the file is redirected to a
    new object and the data in the ``PUT`` request is saved as the data for the
    versioned object. The new object name (for the previous version) is
    ``<versions_container>/<object_name>/<timestamp>``, where the timestamp is
    generated by converting the ``Last-Modified`` header value of the current
    version to a unix timestamp.
    
    A ``GET`` to a versioned object will return the current version of the object
    without having to do any request redirects or metadata lookups.

    StaticWeb fixes.
    
    The previous staticweb had the silly problem of global state for
    concurrent requests. This fixes that.
    
    Also, the WSGI spec indicates start_response might not be called
    right away and is only guaranteed to be called just before the first
    "chunk" of the output iterator returns. This fixes StaticWeb's
    previously incorrect assumption.
    
    A thorough review of this code would be much appreciated; I've
    messed it up enough times to not be completely trusted with it.

    Add an optional delay to account reaping.
    
    Normally, the reaper begins deleting account information for deleted
    accounts immediately. With this patch you can set it to delay its
    work. You set the delay_reaping value in the [account-reaper] section
    of the account-server.conf. The value is in seconds; 2592000 = 30
    days, for example.
    
    Unfortunately, there are currently zero tests for the account-reaper.
    This also needs fixing, but I thought I'd submit this delay patch
    alone for consideration.

    Added optional max_containers_per_account restr...
    
    Added optional max_containers_per_account restriction. If set to a
    positive value and if a client tries to perform a container PUT when
    at or above the max_containers_per_acount cap, a 403 Forbidden will
    be returned with an explanatory message.
    
    This only restricts the proxy server, not any of the background
    processes that might need to create containers (replication, for
    instance). Also, the container count is cached for the proxy's
    recheck_account_existence number of seconds. For these reasons, a
    given account could exceed this cap before the 403 Forbidden
    responses kick in and therefore this feature should be considered a
    "soft" limit.
    
    You may also add accounts to the proxy's max_containers_whitelist
    setting to have accounts that ignore this cap.

    Alternate meta header removal method.
    
    Prior to this patch, you removed header metadata (such as
    x-account-meta-name or x-container-meta-name) by sending the header
    with no value. However, many tools such as curl will not send headers
    with empty values.
    
    This patch adds an alternate method for header metadata removal: Send
    an x-remove-account-meta-name (x-remove-container-meta-name) header
    with any value and the proxy will translate it to the original header
    name with no value, indicating removal.
    
    For safety, if you specify both x-remove-account-meta-name and
    x-account-meta-name headers in the same request, the -remove header
    will be ignored.

    Small change to staticweb with container reques...
    
    Small change to staticweb with container requests. Before, a request
    to a container that had no x-container-meta-web-index and no
    x-container-meta-web-listings would pass the request on to the proxy
    server, even if x-web-mode was set to true. Now, if x-web-mode is set
    true, it will 404.
    
    This mostly important to folks that are using staticweb with an
    external service that uses authenticated requests and x-web-mode set
    to true, in which case the above 404 previously would return the
    container listing (you were authenticated after all). Unauthenticated
    requests would have received 401s anyway.

    Refactor partition gathering.
    
    RingBuilder._reassign_parts() is really moving one (partition,
    replica) pair at a time. However, the way that _gather_reassign_parts
    passes that data in was strange; it would update each replica's entry
    in _replica2part2dev to 0xffff, then return a list of affected
    partitions. Now it just returns the pairs to move.
    
    This is helpful in the presence of bugs that affect partition
    assignment (e.g. #943493), there's no chance of stray 0xffff values
    hanging around and corrupting the partition map.
    
    Also, update my email address.

    Improvements to database replication.
    
    Note: I'd like to get this released as soon as possible as it is a
    data durability issue.
    
    1) Orders nodes so that none get starved (see code and footnote).
    
    2) New max_diffs setting that caps how long the replicator will spend
       trying to sync a given database per pass so the other databases
       don't get starved.
    
    3) Replaces run_pause with the more standard "interval", which means
       the replicator won't pause unless it takes less than the interval
       set.

    Fix rebalancing when 2+ of a partition's replicas are on deleted devices.
    
    RingBuilder._reassign_parts assumed that only replica for a given
    partition would move. This isn't necessarily true in the case where a
    bunch of devices have been removed. This would leave invalid entries
    in _replica2part2dev and also cause validation to fail.
    
    One easy way to reproduce this is to create a 3-replica, 3-zone,
    6-device ring with 2 drives per zone (all of equal weight), rebalance,
    and then remove one drive from each zone and rebalance again.

    Add Fedora to SAIO.
    
    In the past we had a document at Wiki, called RHELInstructions,
    but it was permanently out of date, and someone deleted it, in
    order to stop the confusion.
    
    Differences for Fedora as quite small and it makes sense to maintain
    them inside the main document.
    
    This patch also fixes a couple of obvious problems:
     - a missing period
     - unwanted leading space that breaks a paragraph
    
    Still no idea how to remove color from [swift-hash].

    Add --auth_url, --username and --password and OS_* env vars as
    aliases to --auth, --user and --key.
    
    Default to --auth-version=2.0 if none of --auth, --user or --key
    are set or if OS_AUTH_URL is set.
    
    Ensure trailing '/' is present in --auth so URLs are created correctly.

    Consistent timestamp formatting for last_modified.
    
    Fixes bug 798268.
    
    Python datetime's isoformat() uses %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f format, but
    the miliseconds part is not included when it's zero.
    
    As consequence the compliant ISO 8601 format was not consistent
    when performing a GET request over a container (listing objects info).

    Explain how replication works more clearly
    
    A replicator creates an extra replica when it detects a remote disk
    failure. However, when it fails to create a replica due to other
    reasons (e.g. entire node failures), it doesn't create another replica

    Fixes to prevent socket hoarding...
    
    Main thing is the addition of a Queue between reading from the backend
    server's httplib.Response and the frontend client's webob.Response,
    allowing timeouts on either end to tear down the sockets.
    
    Also, Connection: close headers were added to backend requests since
    we only ever do one request per connection; this will tear down those
    connections more quickly after the request is complete.
    
    Finally, the eventlet.wsgi.WRITE_TIMEOUT is set in case the Eventlet
    version supports it, timing out writes to client connections if they
    take too long to read.

    I noticed that a couple of tests I recently made were

    script:
    
    from sys import exit
    from unittest import TestSuite, TextTestRunner
    
    from test.unit.obj.test_server import TestObjectController
    
    s = TestSuite()
    s.addTest(TestObjectController('test_GET_but_expired'))
    s.addTest(TestObjectController('test_HEAD_but_expired'))
    for x in xrange(200):
        if TextTestRunner().run(s).failures:
            exit('!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TEST FAILED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!')
    print '\o/ Test ran 200 times without failure.'

    Add support for OS Auth API version 2
    
    Add a switch -2 to allow authenticate against service providing
    OpenStack auth version 2.0 (ie: keystone).
    
    By default it will authenticate against v1.0 and you can explicitely
    force it by adding a --auth-version 1 if in future we decide to set 2.0
    auth as default.
    
    It will handle the format tenant:user to indentify to a specific tenant,
    if this format is not specified it will assume user is the same as
    tenant.

    so that it can automatically determine the canonical gerrit location
    for the repository when first run.  Later, rfc.sh will be updated to
    indicate it is deprecated, and then eventually removed.

    Add more specific error messages to swift-ring-builder
    
    Replace existing Exceptions in ring builder with more specific exceptions.
    Abstracted out some behavior in ring-builder that is likely to cause an
    exception. Add try/except blocks to swift-ring-builder to catch specific
    exceptions and provide the user with some information about how to deal
    with the error.

    obj replicator can now log replication stats for recon directly:
    
    in object-server.conf:
    
    [object-replicator]
    vm_test_mode = yes
    recon_enable = yes
    recon_cache_path = /var/cache/swift
    
    Also replaced the swift-recon bash cronjob with a friendlier/cleaner python version, that now only obtains async stats. Basic usage:
    
    $ bin/swift-recon-cron
    Usage: swift-recon-cron CONF_FILE
    
    #CONF_FILE = path to your object-server.conf
    
    $ bin/swift-recon-cron /etc/swift/object-server.conf

    Proposed fix for bug #837428.
    
    To test:
    Create an object without an x-timestamp or x-put-timestamp header and request the object with the X-newest header.
    
    Without the patch, the proxy will return a 404 object not found even though the storage nodes return the object to the proxy.
    
    With the patch, the proxy will return the first object received unless an object with a newer timestamp header exists.

    webob will tack on 'charset: utf-8' for certain content-types (text/plain, startswith: text/, application/, etc) when initialized with a content-type.  swift stores the content-type as passed by the client in the xattrs which was then used in the initializer for the Response in the object server. This could cause extra charsets to be appended in certain conditions.  The change involves taking the content-type out of the initializer and assigning it directly to what is in the xattrs.  this bypasses the webob charset addition.

    You can specify X-Newest: true on GETs and HEADs to indicate you want Swift to query all backend copies and return the newest version retrieved.
    Object COPY requests now always copy the newest object they can find.
    Object POSTs are implemented as COPYs now by default (you can revert to previous implementation with conf object_post_as_copy = false)
    Account and container GETs and HEADs now shuffle the nodes they use to balance load.

    In light of the upcoming Keystone auth service, which should become the standard OpenStack auth service, Swauth will need to move to its own project. Because we don't want the Swift project to require Keystone (or Swauth or any other auth service for that matter) we need a "placeholder". In this proposal I'm adding a TempAuth to fill our auth testing needs within Swift and removing Swauth.
    
    To quickly change from Swauth on a standard SAIO install, change swauth in your pipeline to tempauth and add the following section:
    
    [filter:tempauth]
    use = egg:swift#tempauth
    user_test_tester = testing .admin
    user_test2_tester2 = testing2 .admin
    user_test_tester3 = testing3
    user_system_root = testpass .admin .reseller_admin

    Add a __canonical_version__ attribute to the swift module. This is only the numbered part of the version string, no "-dev" or similar suffixes.
    
    Add a couple of unit tests to make sure __version__ and __canonical_version__ are generated correctly and to ensure __canonical_version__ never accidentally has anything other than numbers and points in it.

    I rewrote swift-init cause I wanted it to do somethings it didn't, and I
    tried to make some of the error conditions a little better too.  It has
    some new features, but overall it's behavior is mostly compatible with
    the old swift-init (input, return codes) - but if someone had some weird
    greps on the output they're hozed.
    
    swift-init --help is a good place to start
    
    some highlights might be:
     $swift-init start main --wait  # wait for all "main" services to start,
    printing any errors to console
     $swift-init rest wait  # same as above but for replicators, updaters & auditors
     $swift-init stop object -c1  # kill the first object-server "node"
     $swift-init object-server status  # make sure it's dead - yay status!
     $swift-init proxy auth reload  # devauth?  srsly?
     $swift-init *-replicator once -n  # run the object, container,
    and account replicators in "once mode" and watch them log to console
    until they're finished
    
    ... probably some other stuff too.  Looking forward to feedback...

    logging refactor to support proxy access logs
    
    New log level "notice" set to python log level 25 maps to syslog priority
    LOG_NOTICE.  Used for some messages in the proxy server, but will be available
    to all apps using the LogAdapter returned from get_logger.  Cleaned up some
    code in get_logger so that console logging works with log_routes and removed
    some unneeded bits.  NamedFormatter functionality was split between LogAdapter
    (which now inherits from logging.LoggerAdapter) and TxnFormatter (which now is
    only responsible for adding the log records txn_id).
    
    The proxy server app now configures a separate logger for access line logging.
    By default it will use the same settings as the regular proxy logger.

    The default reseller_prefix in swift is "AUTH". The domain_remap feature fails in this case because browsers tend to convert urls to lowercase and so by the time the remapped url reaches proxy-server, it is not correct and the request fails.
    
    Changed the code so that if the account starts with the wrongly cased version of reseller prefix, it is corrected. reseller_prefix read from proxy-server.conf.

    Fixes to get audit to run cleanly over datasets where people have i18n strings (ie. bit 7 set utf-8 bytes) in container and object names.
    
    Arguably these fixes aren't the most elegant or complete, but for now it suffices to get things working until we re-factor things later.
    
    
    Also tweak output from  foo... to "foo" (so cut & paste works a little better).

    swauth: add s3api support
    
    This changes handle_put_user() to put 'x-object-meta-account-id' to a
    user object. The metadata includes an cfaccount like
    x-container-meta-account-id.
    
    The above enables swauth to avoid issuing two HTTP requests per single
    S3 request, that is, swauth get the password and cfaccount from the
    account and user by issuing 'GET /v1/(auth_account)/(account)/(user)'
    
    If swauth can't get 'x-object-meta-account-id' metadata from a user
    object (the existing user objects), it issues 'GET
    /v1/(auth_account)/(account)' to get the cfaccount.

    s3api: fix AWSAccessKeyId
    
    We use cfaccount as AWSAccessKeyId (something like
    AUTH_89308df71f274e33af17779606f08fa0). However, users with the same
    account use the same cfaccount. In such case, we can't know which
    password should be used as a secret key to calculate the HMAC.
    
    This changes AWSAccessKeyId to the combination of account and user:
    
    Authorization: AWS test:tester:xQE0diMbLRepdf3YB+FIEXAMPLE=
    
    The auth validates the HMAC and sends a cfaccount back to the
    proxy. The proxy rewrites the path with the cfaccount.

    Seems that the following operations work with boto:
    
    - List of buckets
    - Create bucket
    - Delete bucket
    - List of objects in a bucket
    - PUT object
    - GET object
    - DELETE object
    - HEAD object
    
    Swift account (something like AUTH_89308df71f274e33af17779606f08fa0) is used as AWSAccessKeyId.
    Swift password (passed to swift-auth-add-user) is used as AWS Secret Access Key.
    
    S3 client concatenates selected elements of a request to form a string, uses AWS Secret Access Key to calculate the HMAC of that string, and then put the HMAC value to the HTTPAuthorization header.
    
    The proxy server sends the account info, the formed string of a request, and the HMAC value included with the request to the auth server. The auth server finds AWS Secret Access Key from the account info, use the key to calculate the HMAC of the string, and sees if it matches the HMAC value.

    At least in theory, the code is not functionally different. It's just physically restructured internally so that the help strings are now docstrings within each command/function.  There are other improvements possible, such as including test code in the docstring. I love Python!

    s3api: fix GETorHEAD
    
    - replace 'content-length and 'content-encoding' with 'Content-Length
      and 'Content-Encoding' respectively.
    
    - return 'Content-Type' and 'last-modified' headers too.
    
    - remove 'Content-MD5' since seems that S3 doesn't use it for GET or
      HEAD response.

    For ACL strings: Shortened .ref to just .r, though .ref, .referer, and .referrer are all accepted. Updated 'Creating Your Own Auth Middleware' to describe how the DevAuth server works and suggestions for creating one's own. Added reseller_prefix (optional) implementation. Used urlparse in referrer_allowed. Fixed bug where group names would get lowercased by clean_acl. Changed .r:any to .r:*. Allowed .r:*.example.com to mean .r:.example.com. Made proxy log just the first authenticated group (the user) alongside the token. Moved proxy callback to clean_acl before the length check of the metadata. Cleaned up redundant logic in first proxy swift.authorize callback. Bit better docs. More and updated tests.

    If you issue a write_ring to swift-ring-builder, but there's no nodes in the ring, it crashes out.  This will cause it not to crash and write an empty ring.gz file.
    
    This is mainly helpful for enabling servers on nodes before pushing out a centrally generated master ring.
